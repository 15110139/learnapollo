# Get started

In this chapter, we will setup our awesome Pokedex app. The first thing we need to do is to configure our environment, tools, and GraphQL endpoint.

## Tools

You only need [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and a Node package manager like [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) or [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) to get started with working on the Pokedex application!

## Making the most of this tutorial

We offer different so called *tutorial tracks* for the included Pokedex application! Choose between React, Angular 2 and React-Native. You can choose the technology you feel most comfortable with or try out something new. Each exercise builds upon the previous one and features the individual steps needed to finish it. And if you're not sure how to best approach a task, just take a sneak peek at the provided solution folder or drop by at our [Slack channel](http://slack.graph.cool

Additionally to the Apollo tutorial, we offer a few selected excursions that will zoom in on more specific topics such as the *Redux DevTools* or *optimistic UI*.

## GraphQL Endpoint

Normally, Apollo requires you to set up a GraphQL server on your own. However, for the sake of convenience, we already prepared your own GraphQL server and set it up properly for you! This means you can start working on the Pokedex application without worrying about configuring your own GraphQL server. Request your individual GraphQL endpoint to start on your favorite track of this interactive tutorial!
