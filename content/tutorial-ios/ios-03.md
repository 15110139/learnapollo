# Advanced Queries - iOS Tutorial (3/6)

This is the 3rd exercise in the **iOS Track** of this Apollo Client Tutorial!

## Goal

In this exercise we will have a look at advanced query features with the **goal** of showing a list of pokemon that the trainer owns:

!["Display owned Pokemons"](../images/ios-ex03-final.png "Display owned Pokemons")


## Introduction

Open the directory that contains the 3rd exercise (`exercise-03`) and open `pokedex-apollo.xcworkspace`. It already contains a running version of the code you wrote in the previous lesson. Note that we added a new class called `PokemonCell` that we will use to display your Pokemons in the second section of the table view. 


## Display a List of Pokemons with Advanced Query Features

Before we start working directly on our goal to show the pokemons a trainer owns, let's take some time to get more familiar with some of the available options when using queries.


### Query Variables

In the previous lesson, our query contained a hardcoded string that was the trainer's name. Often times you'll however want to introduce dynamic behaviour in queries, that is we don't want to hardcode values but rather introduce them at runtime. This way, the queries we write are much more useful and can be reused in different contexts. In the Pokedex example, the app could be extended to show the Pokedexes of multiple trainers, but we won't know _all_ the available trainers beforehand and certainly don't want to write identical queries for all of them.

So, let's see how we can use query variables to solve this issue. Here is the same query we used before, only that this time the name of the trainer can be passed into the query as a variable:

```graphql@PokedexTableViewController.graphql
query Trainer($name: String!) {
  Trainer(name: $name) {
    id
    name
  }
}
```

> Note: If you want to test this query in [GraphiQL](https://api.graph.cool/simple/v1/__PROJECT_ID__), you'll have to add the query variable in the bottom left panel: `{ "name": "__NAME__"}`.

Let's quickly understand the syntax of the parametrized query. When declaring the query named `Trainer`, we can add as many arguments to it as we like by listing them in parantheses. Similar to function arguments in Swift, we need to provide a _name_ and a _type_ for each argument. In our case, we only have one (mandatory) argument called `name` that is of type `String`. Variables are always prepended with a `$`. Then, _inside_ the query we can just access the variable by referencing it with its name. 

Go ahead and replace the existing query in `PokedexTableViewController.graphql` with the new query that accepts the trainer's name as a variable, then build the project again using `CMD + B` and inspect `API.swift`. The only initializer of `TrainerQuery` now takes a `String` as an argument which it assigns to a newly added property called `name`. 

```swift
public final class TrainerQuery: GraphQLQuery {

  ...

  public let name: String

  public init(name: String) {
    self.name = name
  }

  public var variables: GraphQLMap? {
    return ["name": name]
  }

  ...
}
```

This is also precisely the reason why the compiler throws an error right now, since in our previous usage of the initializer in `PokedexTableViewController.swift`, we didn't provide any arguments. So, let's go and fix that!

Open `PokedexTableViewController.swift` and add the `name` argument when instantiating `TrainerQuery`:

```swift@PokedexTableViewController.swift
let trainerQuery = TrainerQuery(name: "__NAME__")
```

Run the app again to validate that everything still works as before.

> Note: Using the **Apollo iOS client**, all query variables will be represented as properties on the corresponding classes and need to be provided upon initialization (unless of course they're optional, in which case they default to `nil`).


### Nested Queries

Now that we saw query variables in action, we can focus on displaying the Pokemons of a given trainer. We are going to use the second section of our table view for that, each pokemon will be displayed in a `PokemonCell`.

Therefore, we need to be able to ask for all the `ownedPokemons` of a trainer. We can do so by _nesting_ a query for pokemon data inside the query for the trainer. It'll look like this:

```graphql@PokedexTableViewController.graphql
query Trainer($name: String!) {
  Trainer(name: $name) {
    id
    name
    ownedPokemons {
      id
      name
      url
    }
  }
}
```

> Note: **Nested queries** are where GraphQL really shines compared to REST. With a REST API, it usually requires multiple calls to request data that goes over one or two relationships in a data model, with GraphQL all data requirements can be specified upfront in the query and the data can be fetched within only one API call! ðŸ’¯

The above query requests all Pokemons that are owned by the trainer called `$name`, which is a variable that we are passing to the `TrainerQuery`'s initializer upon creation. The Pokemons will be returned as an array, and each of them will have an `id`, a `name` and a `url`. If you run this query in [GraphiQL](https://api.graph.cool/simple/v1/__PROJECT_ID__), you'll see that your Pokemon team already consists of three Pokemon.

Go ahead and replace the existing query in `PokedexTableViewController.graphql` with the query above, then hit `CMD + B` and inspect `API.swift` again. 

We just got another nested struct, this time it's called `OwnedPokemon` and nested inside `TrainerQuery.Data.Trainer`. This well reflects the nesting inside the query. Also notice that the `TrainerQuery.Data.Trainer` got a new property, which is an array of `TrainerQuery.Data.Trainer.OwnedPokemon`.

Let's use this new type in our code! In `PokedexTableViewController.swift`, we can now make use of the fact that the `TrainerQuery.Data.Trainer` knows its owned Pokemons, so we can actually display the correct number of Pokemons rather than a hardcoded `0`. Change the generation of the `greetingString` inside `tableView(_ tableView: UITableView, cellForRowAt indexPath: IndexPath)` like so:

```swift@PokedexTableViewController.swift
let greetingString: String
if let name = trainer?.name,
   let ownedPokemons = trainer?.ownedPokemons {
    greetingString = "Hello \(name), you have \(ownedPokemons.count) Pokemons in your Pokedex."
}
else {
    greetingString = "Hello, are you even a trainer?!"
}
```

Next, we also want to return the right number of cells for the second table view section, so inside `tableView(_ tableView: UITableView, numberOfRowsInSection section: Int)`, change the last return statement to:

```swift@PokedexTableViewController.swift
return trainer?.ownedPokemons?.count ?? 0
```

Finally, we actually want to display the Pokemons on the table view cells. Therefore, let's add a new property to `PokemonCell`:

```swift@PokemonCell.swift
var ownedPokemon: TrainerQuery.Data.Trainer.OwnedPokemon? {
    didSet {
        updateUI()
    }
}
```  

We're using the `didSet` property observer again to update the UI elements right after the `ownedPokemon` was assigned, so let's add the `updateUI()` method that is invoked here:

```swift@PokemonCell.swift
func updateUI() {
    if let name = ownedPokemon?.name {
        nameLabel.text = name
    }
    if let pokemonURL = ownedPokemon?.url {
        request = Alamofire.request(pokemonURL).responseImage { response in
            if let image = response.result.value {
                self.pokemonImageView.image = image
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Finally, we need to actually return a `PokemonCell` from `tableView(_ tableView: UITableView, cellForRowAt indexPath: IndexPath)`. So, replace the code that generates the cells for the second section (which currently crashes the app with a call to `fatalError()`) like so:

```swift@PokedexTableViewController.swift
case Sections.pokemons.rawValue:
    let cell = tableView.dequeueReusableCell(withIdentifier: "PokemonCell", for: indexPath) as! PokemonCell
    cell.ownedPokemon = trainer?.ownedPokemons[indexPath.row]
    return cell
```

Running the app now will display all your Pokemons in the second table view section. Great, you just used a GraphQL query with nesting and a query variable!


## Recap

Before we move to the next lessons, let's quickly recap what we learned:
- The queries we define in our `.graphql` files can receive variables
- Each variable has a _name_ and a _type_ and can specified to be mandatory using an exclamation point after the type
- In the actual Swift code, variables are passed using the query's initializer
- Queries can be nested, allowing us to precisely express our data requirements and fetching all required data in a single request - even over multiple relationships in our data model!
