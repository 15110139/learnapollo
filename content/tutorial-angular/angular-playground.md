# Angular 2 Playground

Right now, we only have a playground for Angular 2. Download the app, read the code and play around a bit!

If you would like to contribute to Learn Apollo by adding more features to the Angular 2 app, such as a detailed pokemon card or the ability to add new pokemons, head over to [GitHub](http://github.com/learnapollo/pokedex-angular) or [Slack](https://slack.graph.cool) and chat with us!

## Getting Started

Sign up with GitHub and download your individual Angular 2 Pokedex App:

<!-- __DOWNLOAD_ANGULAR__ -->

Run the application:

```sh
cd pokedex-angular-master/playground
yarn install # or npm install
yarn start # or npm start
# open localhost:3000
```
